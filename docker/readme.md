# Docker Simulation Environment

This Docker setup generates **synthetic aggregated behavior patterns** for demonstration and testing.

## Purpose

- Demonstrate how aggregated behavior data could be produced
- Provide repeatable, deterministic outputs
- Avoid any real network dependency

## What It Generates

- Synthetic behavior logs
- Pattern-aligned JSON outputs
- No external inputs required

## Usage

```bash
docker compose up
